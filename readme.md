## 🐟 Project Overview

**Aqua Mate** is an IoT-based smart monitoring system designed to help fishermen and hatchery owners manage their fish ponds with precision and ease.  
Using an **ESP32** microcontroller with sensors (pH, temperature, DO), it continuously collects water quality data and sends it to a **cloud-connected web dashboard**.  
Fishermen can view real-time readings, receive alerts, and take timely action — ensuring healthier fish and higher productivity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an IoT device to measure essential hatchery parameters (pH, temperature, DO).
- Send live readings to a cloud database through Node.js API.
- Develop a user-friendly dashboard for real-time & historical data.
- Generate alerts and email notifications for unsafe water conditions.
- Allow multi-hatchery management with secure device–user linking.
- Support data-driven aquaculture practices.
